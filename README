To build and test these modules:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test

If all tests run without errors, you can complete the installation 
process.

  make install

This final stage might require superuser privileges.

If the building and testing process throws any erros, DO NOT attempt to 
install. The problem will probably be solved by installing some 
pre-requisite as indicated in the errors, but it might also be an 
indicator of some underlying problems with the code in the modules.

More detailed installation instructions can be found in INSTALL file.

Please send bug reports to nwetters@cpan.org or submit a bug report
through the module's request tracker:
