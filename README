To build and test these modules:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test TEST_VERBOSE=1

If all tests run without errors, you can complete the installation process.

  make install

This final stage might require superuser privileges.

If the building and testing process throws any erros, DO NOT attempt to 
install. The problem will probably be solved by installing some pre-requisite 
as indicated in the errors, but it might also be an indicator of some 
underlying problems with the code in the modules.
